# During Version 1.0.0 - 2025/5/28 

Debugging means frequent restarts - so I tested mostly on Duel maps, which needs least loading time. Seeing Osaka's vacant face next to the word "Duel" always makes me feel like I'm about to fight her...  
Even now, I don't feel confident calling myself a "modder". There's still no leader voice lines, no agenda, no wonders..., which are very common in civ6 mod community. I can't even model anything yet. I hope to work on that during summer vacation.

Much of this mod's design is added just because I found their mechanics are underused in the base game. As a result, some designs may feel clunky. I still lack a deep understanding of Civ6's systems and coding. Maybe I'll learn from other popular mods on the Workshop - even though I haven't tried most vanilla leaders.

Those who draw, are truly remarkable! To fill in Osaka's portrait, I had to extend her head manually from anime screenshots, which was quite tedious. And even so, if you zoom in, you'll still see messy strokes. Artists truly are amazing. Even this tiny task gave me a deep appreciation for their craft.

And I still haven't found a clean way to trigger Anarchy, so my current method is still not "beautiful".
