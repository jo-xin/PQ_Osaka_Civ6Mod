# During Version 0.9.0 - 2025/5/5 

This mod was rushed during the International Workers' Day (May Day) holiday, and there are many unfinished parts:
City/unit names reuse Japan's default in-game entries  
Chiyo-Chichi's model uses two dogs (may cause prolonged combat animations unless Quick Combat is enabled - though this issue exists in vanilla too)  
It's sorry that because of heavy university workload, critical updates will be delayed ðŸ˜­
