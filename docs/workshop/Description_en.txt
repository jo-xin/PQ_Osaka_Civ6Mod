Hello, every nyan!

Adds a new civilization - Azumanga Daioh with unique units, improvements, and districts! 
Just like the anime's easygoing pace, this civilization thrives on high Amenities, which boost national yields.
The unique unit Chiyo-Chichi also adds exploration fun!

Installing [b][url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3489191920]my second mod[/url][/b] is also highly recommended, which shows world exploration progress in the top UI bar - and see how much mobility Chiyo-Chichi will gain in detail!

[h2]  Civilization Ability [/h2]
A Chiyo-chichi will be placed near capital next turn if you do not have one. No starting Warrior. Gain +1 Culture for each Amenity.

[h2] Unique Unit - Chiyo-Chichi [/h2]
A unique recon unit which can jump. Cannot be produced or purchased, cannot attack. Gains +10 Combat Strength for each era, and increase its mobility as you explore the world. Disappears when Exoplanet Expedition begins.

[h2]Unique Improvement - Summer House [/h2]
A unique Tile Improvement which is similar to Seaside Resort, provides +1 extra Amenity but -1 Production until Education.

[h2] Unique District - High School [/h2]
A unique campus district which gains more Science from Summer House, Theater Square or Entertainment Complex, but less from mountain tiles.



[h1] Kasuga Ayumu (Osaka) [/h1]
[quote=Kasuga Ayumu]
Saata Andagi~
[/quote]

Introduces a new leader - Kasuga Ayumu (Osaka) with unique mechanics!

[h2] Osaka [/h2]
All new cities will be considered on a different continent than original capital. 

[h2] Daydreamer [/h2]
Enter Anarchy when unlocking new Government or world enters a new Era as long as Government has once been changed. Policy and Government changes become free on the turn AFTER completing a Civic or ending Anarchy, but not immediately completing a Civic. When Anarchy ends, you also gain one free Eureka and Inspiration from the next era.


[h2] Riddle Master [/h2]
Triggering an Inspiration will grant 30% progress toward a random technology with Eureka triggered.



[h1] Music [/h1]
Add 13 OST BGM for the civilization, from KURICORDER QUARTET. For optimal experience, install [b][url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2225900548]BGM Fix Mod[/url][/b].
* BGM list see the last image in the album of mode description



[h1] Roadmap [/h1]
[list]
    [*]Expand Osaka's content: add leader agendas & dialogue, and add her cute voice into dialog like normal leaders.
    [*]Create a simple promotional trailer video
    [*]Add new resource "Saata Andagi"
    [*]Introduce Wonders (e.g., Culture/Sports Festivals, with abilities, like boosting yields when Amenities >5)
    [*]Add more leaders (e.g. Mihama Chiyo—"Genius" ability to mitigate tech/civic penalties from later Eras)
[/list]
