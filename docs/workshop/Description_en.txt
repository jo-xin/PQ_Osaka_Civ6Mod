First major release! A substantial update - check the changelog at the end for full details.

[h1] Introduction [/h1]
This mod supports both Chinese and English.  
As my first mod, feedback is highly welcomed! Reporting bugs, balancing issues (too strong or too weak), or suggesting new ideasâ€”even asset replacements! Please don't hesitate to share!

The World Exploration progress tracking UI feature shown in some screenshots comes from a separate mod of mine, [b] and is not included here. [/b]You may find it here: [b][url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3489191920]World Exploration Progress[/url][/b]

Adds a new civilization - Azumanga Daioh with unique units, improvements, and districts! 
Just like the anime's easygoing pace, this civilization thrives on high Amenities, which boost national yields.
The unique unit Chiyo-Chichi also adds exploration fun!

Installing [b][url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3489191920]my second mod[/url][/b] is also highly recommended, which shows world exploration progress in the top UI bar - and see how much mobility Chiyo-Chichi will gain in detail!

[h2]  Civilization Ability [/h2]
A Chiyo-chichi will be placed near capital next turn if you do not have one. No starting Warrior. Gain +1 Culture for each Amenity.

[h2] Unique Unit - Chiyo-Chichi [/h2]
A unique recon unit which can jump. Cannot be produced or purchased, cannot attack. Gains +10 Combat Strength for each era, and increase its mobility as you explore the world. Disappears when Exoplanet Expedition begins.

[h2]Unique Improvement - Summer House [/h2]
A unique Tile Improvement which is similar to Seaside Resort, provides +1 extra Amenity but -1 Production until Education.

[h2] Unique District - High School [/h2]
A unique campus district which gains more Science from Summer House, Theater Square or Entertainment Complex, but less from mountain tiles.



[h1] Kasuga Ayumu (Osaka) [/h1]

Introduces a new leader - Kasuga Ayumu (Osaka) with unique mechanics!

[h2] Osaka [/h2]
All new cities will be considered on a different continent than original capital. 

[h2] Daydreamer [/h2]
Enter Anarchy when unlocking new Government or world enters a new Era as long as Government has once been changed. Policy and Government changes become free on the turn AFTER completing a Civic or ending Anarchy, but not immediately completing a Civic. When Anarchy ends, you also gain one free Eureka and Inspiration from the next era.


[h2] Riddle Master [/h2]
Triggering an Inspiration will grant 30% progress toward a random technology with Eureka triggered.



[h1] Music [/h1]
Add 13 OST BGM for the civilization, from KURICORDER QUARTET. For optimal experience, install [b][url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2225900548]BGM Fix Mod[/url][/b].
* BGM list see the last image in the album of mode description



[h1] Roadmap [/h1]
[list]
    [*]Expand Osaka's content: add leader agendas & dialogue, and add her cute voice into dialog like normal leaders.
    [*]Create a simple promotional trailer video
    [*]Add new resource "Saata Andagi"
    [*]Introduce Wonders (e.g., Culture/Sports Festivals, with abilities, like boosting yields when Amenities >5)
    [*]Add more leaders (e.g. Mihama Chiyoâ€”"Genius" ability to mitigate tech/civic penalties from later Eras)
[/list]

[h1]Special Thanks[/h1]
[b][url=space.bilibili.com/28399130]hemmelfort[/url][/b]: Authored comprehensive Civilization VI modding tutorials for the Chinese community, and this mod's foundation relies on his work.  
[b][url=steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198402598762]UzukiShimamura[/url][/b]: Provided critical implementation references.  
[b][url=steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198864459088]RUIVO[/url][/b] â€“ His adjacency mechanics helped me a lot, like Lua-db interaction insights, and Lua-modifier interaction, and so on.  
[b]AI SAMA[/b] â€“ ChatGPT, DeepSeek, etc., for help with translation and text
[b][url=space.bilibili.com/3546631957908287]L24[/url][/b] â€“ The first to truly playtest this mod from a gameplay design perspective and offer valuable feedback - far more effort than I have done!


[h1] Dev Notes [/h1]
[h2] v1.0.0 (May 28, 2025) [/h2]  
Debugging means frequent restarts - so I tested mostly on Duel maps, which needs least loading time. Seeing Osaka's vacant face next to the word "Duel" always makes me feel like I'm about to fight her...  
Even now, I don't feel confident calling myself a "modder". There's still no leader voice lines, no agenda, no wonders..., which are very common in civ6 mod community. I can't even model anything yet. I hope to work on that during summer vacation.

Much of this mod's design is added just because I found their mechanics are underused in the base game. As a result, some designs may feel clunky. I still lack a deep understanding of Civ6's systems and coding. Maybe I'll learn from other popular mods on the Workshop - even though I haven't tried most vanilla leaders.

Those who draw, are truly remarkable! To fill in Osaka's portrait, I had to extend her head manually from anime screenshots, which was quite tedious. And even so, if you zoom in, you'll still see messy strokes. Artists truly are amazing. Even this tiny task gave me a deep appreciation for their craft.

And I still haven't found a clean way to trigger Anarchy, so my current method is still not "beautiful".

[h2] v0.9.0 (May 5, 2025) [/h2]  
This mod was rushed during the International Workers' Day (May Day) holiday, and there are many unfinished parts:
City/unit names reuse Japan's default in-game entries  
Chiyo-Chichi's model uses two dogs (may cause prolonged combat animations unless Quick Combat is enabled - though this issue exists in vanilla too)  
It's sorry that because of heavy university workload, critical updates will be delayed ðŸ˜­
